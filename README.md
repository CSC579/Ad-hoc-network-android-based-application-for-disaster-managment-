# Ad hoc network simulation for disaster management
This is a course project on performance analysis of MANET using Omnet++ tool.

Our focus is to analyse the performance of neighbourhood and clustered route information exchange considering two protocols, that is AODV and DYMO.
The preliminary results show that depending on the mobility of the nodes, the signal to noise ratio is significantly affected. Also we can be able to establish the packet loss ratio from the pkts send from the souce and those that eventually get to the destination.
